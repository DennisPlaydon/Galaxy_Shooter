#Galaxy_Shooter
Simple galaxy shooter game

I created this game over 4 weeks following a udemy course by Jonathon Weinberger on game development. I used unity to code the entire game and wrote scripts in C#. 

##What I learnt

I became much more familiar with Unity. The course equiped me with many skills for future development. This included:
*Using scripts to achieve tasks such as player movement
*Becoming familiar with the unity interface
*Interaction with sprites
*Creating prefabs that I can use in the future

I enjoyed creating the game. I think creating more games in the future will help me and only develop my skills futher
